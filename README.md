## My process
This is my second project with Frontend Mentor. I am using these challenges to really make sure I am learning CSS and not just doing tutorial follow alongs. In this challenge I made use of Perfect Pixel (for the first time) to make it easier to determine design dimensions. I currently work big to small - big key design features get developed first like the content wrapper, sub wrappers, and images. I usually wrap elements in colorful borders to assist with troubleshooting. After that I focus on smaller details like colors, exact font sizing, spacing and margins. I then remove borders and refine any final outiers to the best of my ability.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am still learning how these Frontend Mentor challenges work, how to post solutions, and work with the community.

The benefit of asking for help. Sometimes you can only google within the bounds of what you already know. I really could not figure out what was happenign with the image overlay and I felt like I had googled everything. I joined the Frontend Mentor Slack group and checked the help channel - I someone else had just asked a similar question and received a response. This was enough to point me in the right direction.

### Continued development

I feel I am still designing with too much reliance on manual positioning like padding and margins. Something still doesn't feel quite right even though my designs are very close to matching the design proofs. I also feel there are lines of markup that could be deleted because they are not affecting my design but I cannot just yet determine which ones.

### Useful resources

Perfect Pixel by WellDoneCode https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/ - used to created design image overlay.

I struggled with figuring out how to get the dark purple effect on the main photo. Here are the resources that helped me:

Useful walkthrough of css blend modes - https://alligator.io/css/exploring-blend-modes/

Possibly better explanation (focuses on a single image and background color) and what ultimately helped me here - https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-blend-mode/
